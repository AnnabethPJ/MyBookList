This is a simple book listing app. It is built using HTML CSS and JS. 
It has a form using which user can add a book to list. The user needs to provide book's title, authors name and ISBN. The list of books are show in a tabular format below the form. User is also provided with a delete button which removes the book from the list. There is no permanent storage for the book details and therefore it will not be there if you refresh the page.
